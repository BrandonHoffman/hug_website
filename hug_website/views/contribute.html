<h1>Getting hug setup for local development</h1>
<p>The first step when contributing to any project is getting it setup on your local machine, hug aims to make this as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Account Requirements:
- A valid GitHub account (https://github.com/join)</p>
<p>Base System Requirements:
- Python3.3+
- Python3-venv (included w/ most Python3 installations but some Ubuntu systems require that it be installed separately)
- bash or a bash compatible shell (should be auto-installed on Linux / Mac)
- autoenv - https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv (optional)</p>
<p>Once you have verified that you system matches the base requirements you can start get the project working by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fork the project on GitHub (https://github.com/timothycrosley/hug/fork).</li>
<li>Clone your fork to your local file system:
    <code>git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_ACCOUNT/hug.git</code></li>
<li><code>cd hug</code><ul>
<li>If you have autoenv set-up correctly simply press Y and then wait for the environment to be setup for you.</li>
<li>If you don't have autoenv set-up run <code>source .env</code> to setup the local environment. You will need to run this script everytime you want to work on the project - though it will not cause the entire setup process to re-occur.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>run <code>test</code> to verify your everything is setup correctly, if the tests all pass you have succesfully setup hug for local development! If not you can ask for help diagnosing the error here: https://gitter.im/timothycrosley/hug.</li>
</ol>
