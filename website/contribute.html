  <h1>
    Getting hug setup for local development
  </h1>
  <p>
    The first step when contributing to any project is getting it setup on your local machine, hug aims to make this as simple as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Account Requirements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/join">
        A valid GitHub account
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Base System Requirements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Python3.3+
    </li>
    <li>
      Python3-venv (included w/ most Python3 installations but some Ubuntu systems require that it be installed separately)
    </li>
    <li>
      bash or a bash compatible shell (should be auto-installed on Linux / Mac)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv">
        autoenv
      </a>
      (optional)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Once you have verified that you system matches the base requirements you can start get the project working by following these steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/hug/fork">
        Fork the project on GitHub
      </a>
      .
    </li>
    <li>
      Clone your fork to your local file system:
      <code>
        git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_ACCOUNT/hug.git
      </code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>
        cd hug
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you have autoenv set-up correctly simply press Y and then wait for the environment to be setup for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you don't have autoenv set-up run
          <code>
            source .env
          </code>
          to setup the local environment. You will need to run this script everytime you want to work on the project - though it will not cause the entire setup process to re-occur.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      run
      <code>
        test
      </code>
      to verify your everything is setup correctly, if the tests all pass you have succesfully setup hug for local development! If not you can ask for help diagnosing the error
      <a href="https://gitter.im/timothycrosley/hug">
        here
      </a>
      .
    </li>
  </ol>
